<<<<<<< HEAD
## Objective


### *Create a dynamic and interactive frontend Application that uses the core principles of React.*

Create an **interactive** page/s of their choice using React. Ideally the app will include interactive elements such as forms, links and buttons, along with routes, data fetching and various React hooks as needed, as well as external libraries such as [bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction), [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) and [MUI](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction). 

<br>

## Design Steps:

1. Decide on what you work on
2. Write down your objectives in the file *objectives.md* , in the root directory of this repository.

- Optional: Draw a wireframe of your app
- Optional: List of [FREE APIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15iDpjqyBkSse9wcN7vvQvORBvX8P_ivAjm-iKXp776Y/edit#gid=0) to integrate.
=======

## Objective
Develop a robust backend application that leverages one or more chosen 3rd party APIs, your own APIs, or a combination, while incorporating a database to enhance functionality.
>>>>>>> BE/main

<br>

## Build steps:
<<<<<<< HEAD

Follow the link to the Github Classroom repo and clone it to your local computer
(Inside the repo)

       1. `npx create-next-app@latest` 
       2.  When asked..
              - to provide a name for your mini project: **Yes**, *(e.g. mini-project-2)*
              - Would you like to use TypeScript with this project ? **Yes**, **HIGHLY ENCOURAGED, not required*
              - Would you like to use ESLint with this project? **Yes**
              - Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? **Optional*
              - Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? **No**
              - Use App Router ? **Yes** **RECOMMENDED*
              - Would you like to customize the default import alias? **No**
       
       3. `cd mini-project-2` <sup><sub>(or whatever you named your project)</sub></sup>
       4. `npm install`
       5. `npm run dev`

5. Present your project to the class (Aim for a 5min presentation). The presentation date is in the **(TBD)**, 2024.

<br>

<hr>
=======
1. Initialize Backend Express App: Set up a new Express application for your backend. Ensure it's structured and organized for scalability.

2. Choose a Database: Decide whether you want to use MySQL or MongoDB for your database. Implement a connection to the chosen database.

3. Create CRUD Operations: Develop routes in your Express app that cover all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This ensures a comprehensive functionality for your backend.

4. Build Controllers and Models: Implement controllers and models to handle the business logic and data structure of your application. Keep your code modular and maintainable.

5. Testing with Postman/Bruno: Thoroughly test your backend routes using tools like Postman or Bruno. Ensure that your API endpoints function as expected and handle different scenarios.

6. API Documentation with Swagger UI: Generate clear and concise API documentation using Swagger UI. This documentation should provide detailed information on how to interact with your backend API.

7. Fine-tune and Optimize: Optimize your code for performance and handle edge cases effectively. Ensure that error handling is robust and provides meaningful responses.


> *Presentation Preparation:*
>
> *Prepare a concise and engaging presentation to showcase your backend project to the class. Aim for a 5-minute presentation. Highlight key features, challenges faced, and any unique aspects of your project.*

8. Presentation Date: Plan to present your backend project to the class on the (TBD) of Feb. Be ready to share insights into your design decisions, challenges faced, and the overall functionality of your application.

<br>

By following these steps, you'll create a well-structured, fully functional backend application that effectively integrates 3rd party APIs and a database.

=======
â–ª What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?

```
I wanted create something useful and easy to use. I researched google maps APIs (thankfully free) and knew that it would make my app streamlined.

<<<<<<< HEAD
â–ª If you used Next.JS, could you please share your thoughts on the routing capabilities it offers? How does the routing functionality in Next.js compare to other frameworks or libraries you have worked with in terms of ease of use, flexibility, and any notable features?
 ```md
   answer here
=======
â–ª Give a high level overview of your backend application and its features.

```
Mileage Tracking: Users can record and save their journeys to keep track of mileage, which is useful for tax purposes or business expense reimbursements.

Integration with Google Maps API: Leveraging the Google Maps API, your application can accurately calculate distances and routes for recorded journeys. This ensures precise mileage tracking.

Categorization of Journeys: Users have the ability to categorize their journeys, which helps in organizing and analyzing mileage data. This categorization feature enhances user experience and makes it easier to manage data.

CRUD Operations: The application supports all basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to manage their journey records efficiently. They can create new records, view existing ones, update details if needed, and delete records that are no longer relevant.

Overall, my backend application provides a robust platform for users to effectively manage and track their mileage, with seamless integration with MongoDB and the Google Maps API, along with essential CRUD functionality and categorization features.
