# **MINI-PROJECT 3**

</br>

## Objective - Create a backend that does something useful with a chosen 3rd party API(s) and includes a database

## Design Steps:

1. Choose a API to work with from the list of free APIs - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15iDpjqyBkSse9wcN7vvQvORBvX8P_ivAjm-iKXp776Y/edit#gid=0
2. Decide on what you want to improve / add
3. Write down your objectives in a text doc

## Build steps:

1. Follow the link to the Github Classroom repo and clone it to your local PC
(Inside the repo)
2. Create a new backend express app
3. Connect it to a database (MySQL or MongoDB. You choose)
4. Create routes to perform the required operations. (Make sure you use all CRUD operations at least once!)
5. Create Controllers / Modals
6. Test your routes with Postman
7. Create API documentation with swagger ui

8. Present your backend project to the class (Aim for a 5min presentation. The presentation date is the 22nd May)
