# *the BACKEND*

</div>

</br>

## Objective  
Create a backend that does something useful with a chosen 3rd party API(s) and includes a database

<br>

## Design Steps:

1. Choose a API to work with from the list of [FREE APIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15iDpjqyBkSse9wcN7vvQvORBvX8P_ivAjm-iKXp776Y/edit#gid=0)
2. Decide on what you want to improve / add
3. Write down your objectives in a text doc

## Build steps:

1. Follow the link to the Github Classroom repo and clone it to your local PC
(Inside the repo)
2. Create a new backend express app
3. Connect it to a database (MySQL or MongoDB. You choose)
4. Create routes to perform the required operations. (Make sure you use all CRUD operations at least once!)
5. Create Controllers / Modals
6. Test your routes with Postman
7. Create API documentation with swagger ui

8. Present your backend project to the class (Aim for a 5min presentation. The presentation date is the 22nd May)

<br><br><br><br>

## Ideas to talk about in the presentation

▪ What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?

</br>

▪ Give a high level overview of your application and its features.

</br>

▪ Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?

</br>

▪ How does the back end process this data?

</br>

▪ How can the user interact with this data?

</br>

▪ What JS techniques have you used ?
*(eg. objects/arrays/DOMfunctions/loops/functions/ifs)*

</br>

▪ What external tools/libraries have you used? How? Why?
*(eg. bootstrap/axios/charts)*

</br>


▪ How might you extend the features of your application in future?
